minor_changes:
  - pause - get user input from the main results thread instead of accessing sys.stdin in the worker process.
  - paramiko_ssh - get user input from the main results thread instead of accessing sys.stdin in the worker process.
deprecated_features:
  - >-
    The ConnectionBase()._new_stdin attribute is deprecated.
    Plugins should send a prompt to the main results thread rather than access stdin directly.
    Use the ``send_prompt`` function and ``worker_queue`` from ``ansible.executor.process.worker_sync``.
    You will need to import these within the WorkerProcess.
